**news.jpg**: Twitter bot that tweets news headlines through images from the web.

Still trying to figure out why I made this. Emotionally empty images from the web telling us headlines that carry meaning invokes some form of distortion bw the digital and physical worlds. Sometimes the image representation of the word itself becomes defined by the specific news article (in this case "whistleblower" pulled an image of Trump which is directly correlated to the fact this news break circulated throughout the web enough with the word "whistleblower" and an image of Trump for them to be correlated). I occasionally interpret the representations as insults as if the algorithm has intent. Which is somewhat hypocritical, because in a sense the creator defines intent for the machine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
